# 🔍 RAG-Models: A Collection of Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementations

Welcome to the **RAG-Models** repository! 🚀 This repository serves as a growing collection of various **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models** that I will be developing and refining throughout the year.

## 📌 About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find:

✅ **Jupyter Notebooks** with step-by-step implementations of different RAG architectures.  
✅ **Pre-trained & fine-tuned models** on various datasets.  
✅ **Research insights** and practical applications of RAG in real-world use cases.  
✅ **Code samples** for integrating RAG into your projects.  


## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the models and implementations, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-Models.git
cd RAG-Models
